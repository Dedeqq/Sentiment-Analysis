# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains my project in machine learning with python. I have worked with IMDB dataset of 25K positive and 25K negative movie reviews. I started by analyzing the review texts. I have slightly transformed texts by changing higher case to lower case and then searched for most popular words in reviews. I have presented graphically the results of my research. Before using machine learning models, I got rid of punctuation marks and common words that appeared very frequently in both types of reviews. I tried both lemmatization and stemming, however it did not improve the accuracy of my models. After that i have trained three models and used ensembling for better results. Each of those models has over 80% accuracy. The results are saved in the results.txt file.
