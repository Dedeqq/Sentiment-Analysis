# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains my project in machine learning with python. I have worked with IMDB dataset of 25K positive and 25K negative movie reviews. I started by analyzing the review texts. Before using machine learning models, I got rid of punctuation marks and common words that appeared very frequently in both types of reviews. After that i have trained my three models. Each of them has over 80% accuracy. The results are  saved in the results.txt file.
